# v1.5
- Better support for closed and open ontologies
	- Add option to allow using an ontology or not
	- Ontologies may now be closed or open
	- Explicit way to dynamically define new constants outside of .ont files
- Consolidate unit tests in a separate project
- Remove some unused code
- Removing stripping of redundant lambda operators
	- Simplifying to the canonical form doesn't strip redundant lambda operator. 
	- All implicit lambda operators are always present in the logical form. 
	- Converting a logical form to a string strips lambda operators for readability. 
	- Missing lambda operator in input logical expressions are added.
- Safety assertion in various constructors
- Improved support for joint inference and situated language
- GeoQuery example experiment without the experiment platform -- possibly a better way to get to know the code for some.
- Remove old storage mechanism and add support for saving models using serialization, including helper methods in the Model class.
- Removed concept of fixed lexical entry.
	- No distinction between fixed lexical entries and normal ones.
	- Initialization of seed entries is done using model initializers.
- Migrate all creators to inside the class they are creating (as internal classes).
- Fix bug with initializing the lexicon.
- Remove unused typing features.
- Better and more consistent typing validation and type consistency checks across the framework. 
- Remove support for unary parse rules. Unary operations are now supported only through overloading binary rules. See RuleSetBuilder.
- Hash vector improvements
	- Pairwise hash vector product.
	- Add method to apply a function all values in the hash vector.
- Attach Arxiv publication PDF and BIB files to source code.

# v1.4.1
- Cleaned up using of generics throughout the system. Generic classes should now compatible
- Better logging system - all logs are now public and can be controlled from outside SPF without editing SPF's code
- Javadocs for many generic classes
- Better abstraction in ExPlat's experiment hierarchy
- Better representations of situated data items
